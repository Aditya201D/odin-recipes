        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Chicken biryani</b> is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved 
            for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as <i>Ramadan</i>. 
            It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, 
            <em>basmati</em> rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
        <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>2 large onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp chilli powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon turmeric</li>
            <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless, chicken pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside. </li>
            <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan. </li>
            <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices. </li>
            <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. </li>
            <li>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. </li>
            <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish. </li>
        </ol>
