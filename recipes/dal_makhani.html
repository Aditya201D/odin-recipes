        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Ever go to an Indian restaurant and wonder 
            how they make those lentils? I hated lentils 
            before I discovered Indian food. Then I scoured 
            the internet to figure out how they achieved them, 
            and through mixing and matching recipes and methods 
            on videos, I've arrived at this recipe, which I think 
            is pretty close. This version is very rich, but you can 
            leave out the cream to make it lighter. Kasuri methi 
            (fenugreek leaves) is almost impossible to find in 
            the U.S., even in NYC, but it gives this dish something very special.</p>
